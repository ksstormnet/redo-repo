# Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed plans for different aspects of the Kubuntu system rebuild process. Each document provides a comprehensive overview of implementation strategy, configuration details, and specific recommendations.

## Plan Documents

### [Audio Optimization Plan](audio-optimization-plan.md)

A comprehensive plan for setting up a professional audio environment with PipeWire and real-time optimizations, including:

- Real-time audio performance optimization
- Vocaster 1 USB microphone processing with level boosting
- Audacity workflow improvements 
- VirtualBox audio routing for RadioDJ and StereoTool

### [Backup and Recovery Plan](backup-recovery.md)

Detailed strategy for maintaining system resilience through comprehensive backup and recovery procedures:

- Automated and manual backup procedures 
- Timeshift for system snapshots
- Rsync-based data backups
- LVM snapshot management
- Recovery procedures from various failure scenarios

### [Consolidated LVM Plan](consolidated-lvm-plan-revised.md)

Complete architecture for storage management using Logical Volume Management (LVM):

- Physical drive architecture (SSD for OS + 7 NVMe drives for data)
- Logical volume design with mirroring and striping
- Volume allocation for different workloads
- Installation procedure using scripts during Ubuntu Server installation
- LVM management reference

### [KDE Environment Setup](kde-environment-setup.md)

Detailed guide for configuring a highly efficient KDE Plasma desktop optimized for multiple workflows:

- KDE Activities for different work contexts
- Dual screen panel configuration
- Virtual desktops and window rules
- StreamDeck integration
- Task-specific configurations

### [Migration Plan](migration-plan.md)

Comprehensive roadmap for migrating to the new system with optimized storage and configurations:

- Pre-migration analysis and preparation
- LVM setup and base system installation
- Sequential system installation
- Data migration and organization
- Post-migration verification

## Implementation Strategy

These documents provide both the theoretical foundation and practical implementation details for the system rebuild. They should be used as:

1. Reference material to understand the overall architecture and design decisions
2. Detailed guides for manual configuration when needed
3. Context for the scripts in other directories that automate these processes

## Creating Implementation Plans

The plans in this directory follow a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** section that summarizes the plan's scope and goals
2. **Detailed Sections** that break down specific components
3. **Configuration Examples** with concrete parameters and options
4. **Step-by-Step Procedures** for implementation

When updating or creating new plans, maintain this structure for consistency.
